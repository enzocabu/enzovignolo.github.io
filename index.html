              In <b>2010</b> my studies on <b>Electronics' Engineer </b>,
              attending to <b>Universidad Nacional de Nordeste</b>, a public
              University, located in <b>Corrientes , Argentina</b>, my hometown.
              I finished in <b>2017</b>, specializing my self in
              <b>Telecommunications</b>. Since then I have been working in
              <b>Satellite Communications Area</b>. Though it was fun, I am
              searching to make a career path shift to become a
              <b> Developer.</b> Why? Because I always loved to code!

              -In <b>2017</b> while I was studying, I worked as an <b>Intern</b> on COMYTEL, a small company in charge
              of most of the Satellite Communications around my province, <b>Corrientes</b>. There I performed a lot of <b>field work</b>
              doing satellite migrations on client's side.</p>
              <p>
              - A couple of months after, <b>in June of 2017</b> I started in <b>Global Eagle</b>, working as a Deilvery RF Operator,
              at their <b>Parana's office</b>. There I had to prove support to the field engineers and work on the remote links, performing
              some RF links configuration and troubleshooting.</p><p>
              - A year after, on June of 2018, I moved to <b>Raisting, Germany</b> to keep working at <b>Global Eagle</b>, but now as a <b>Teleport Engineer</b>
              On Teleport side, I mostly work in the infrastructure of the links, performing equipment installation for Satellite Communications.

              As a lot of people, I took 2020's world situation to set new goals for myself. I decided to change my professional career and resume my programming studies, 
              that so far, was more like a hobby to me. 
            </p>
            <p>- On <b>August 2020</b> I decided to start by taking <b>The Web Development Bootcamp</b> by <b>Dr Angela Yu</b> at <b>Udemy</b>. Here I learnt a lot of fundamental concepts
            about how Web pages and applications works. Also i gained some basics skills on <b>HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node and React</b></p>
            <p>-A month later, by <b>September 2020 </b> I've finished my first bootcamp and started another. This one would be a <b>The NodeJS, Express and MongoDB Complete Bootcamp</b> by <b>Jonas Schmedtmann</b>, again at <b>Udemy</b>. There I deepened my skills on <b>NodeJS and MongoDB</b> creating a very complete project.
<p>-Nowadays, I am adding other languages to my skills, currently taking the <b> 100 Days Python Bootcamp </b> created by <b> Dr Angela Yu </b> .I am very exciting to get to know all forms that <b>Python</b> can be used, as the powerful language that is.</p>
<p>I really love to keep learning new technologies!<p>
